# Portfolio

GitHub Page: https://simonasnap.github.io/Full-Stack-Coding-Portfolio/


This is a portfolio of my work. It has a top navigation that then links to an about me section, a gallery of my work, a contact section found at the bottom, as well as my resume. The gallery of work consists of five cards with a main image, a title of my work and a one liner that describes what kind of project it is. All cards link to a page on my design portfolio that is already live on Adobe's my portofolio platform.

What I learned from this homework:
    How to play with flexbox
        - Key tip to myself, set up sections that you want to play within sections and then give those flexbox as well
        - in addition, never forget to define width (it is connected to the last layer of flexbox)
    Added media query
    Also how to link navigation to specific ids used in the html file
