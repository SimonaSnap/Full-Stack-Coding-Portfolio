## What I learned from this homework:
    How to play with flexbox
        - Key tip to myself, set up sections that you want to play within sections and then give those flexbox as well
        - In addition, never forget to define width (it is connected to the last layer of flexbox)
    Added media query
    Also how to link navigation to specific ids used in the html file
